# EduLear
A learning management system backend API designed to manage and organize courses, assessments (quizzes, assignments), student enrollment, performance tracking, and grading. Built using Java Spring Boot, it implements a layered architecture for scalability and separation of concerns. It provides robust and efficient user authentication, course content management, and progress monitoring.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Registration & Login: Using JWT tokens.
- Role-based access: Restrict access permissions so that they are granted based on role type.


### 2. User Management
- User types: Admin, Instructor, Student.
- Profile management: View and update profile details.
- Admin Roles:
    - Manage overall system settings.
    - Create and manage users.
    - Create and manage courses.
- Instructor Roles:
    - Create and manage courses and course content.
    - Add assignments and quizzes.

    - Remove students from courses.
- Student Roles:

    - Access course materials.
    - Submit assignments and take quizzes.
    - View grades for assignments and quizzes.


### 3. Course Management

- Course Enrollment: A student can enroll in any of the available courses.
- Lesson management: Each course can have multiple lessons that course instructors and enrolled students can access.
- Lesson resources: A lesson can have multiple resources (videos, PDFs, audio).

### 4. Assessment & Grading
- Question bank: Each course has a question bank in which instructors can add questions of different types of questions (MCQs, true/false, short answers).
- Assessment creation: Instructors can create announcements for quizzes and assignments.
- Quiz submission: Each student gets randomized questions from the question bank.
- Assignment submission: Students upload assignment files to be graded.
- Grading: Automated grading for quizzes, while assignments require manual review
- Performance Tracking: Students can monitor their quiz scores, assignment submissions, and attendance.


### 5. Notifications
- Student notifications: Receive notifications and email alerts for enrollment confirmations, graded assignments, and course updates.
- Instructor notifications: Receive notifications and email alerts for new enrollments and course-related updates.
